# Pang-Game
An inspired from the game named Pang

Pang-Game
Unity Version: Unity 2019.4.20f1

I created the game for 5 days both coding and editing/gathering visuals myself

** Design Changes from the Original Game **

1. The ball bounces differently from the original game (Reference: Arkanoid Game)
2. When a ball touches the player in its invicible mode, it will destroy the ball. The invicible mode last based on its duration value
3. No Timer
4. The Dynamite/PopBalls only pops one once instead of going to its smallest state
